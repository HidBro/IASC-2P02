        <h2> PART 1: THE BEGINNING</h2>

        <p>The Eterna Star was worshipped by all, the young, grown and the old. It was a pillar that sourced the inhabitant’s humanity, fear, despair and all other emotions that became existent in the land of Feeling. This led to not just the rise of multiple conflicts across the land, but also the creatures of Feeling to be able to think for themselves, and acquiring conciousness.
            Some time passed, and the residents of Feeling feared the day when another entity like the Eterna Star would cause a great chaos in the world, damaging and potentially destroying the Eterna Star. This anticipation led to their fears being materialised in a form they would understand all too well. 
            </p>
        <p>On a fateful day, the people of Feeling bare saw the witness of their source of life and reasoning, repeatedly becoming <span class="clickable" id="first-change",>enveloped in a bubble</span>.</p>

        <p>The unknown entity invaded the world for a long period of time, making jest of the Star's disappearance, looking down on the residents of Feeling, making them feel unworthy of their humanity and overall, initiating its prophesied plan of destruction. While the unknown entity relished in its heightened position, It suddenly came to a 
            <span class="clickable" id="second-change",>stop</span>.</p>

        <p>With the people of Feeling eventually becoming accustomed to the foreboding bubble laying over the world, the people still continued to live on, having the impending sense of doom looming over them. Unbeknownst to them, the mysterious bubble still had plans that affected more than the world that is currently perceived by the residents of Feeling. The star and the bubble, which once stood bold and in full definition, suddenly started 
            <span class="clickable" id="eighth-change",>fading out of reality</span>.</p>

        <p>The inhabitants of Feeling’s long reign of contempt were broken as panic and pandemonium spread across the landscape. Witnessing the fading out of the Eterna Star and the bubble, the residents of Feeling fully believed that the prophecies of the end of their reality were being witnessed at this current moment. This was a historical moment that would change the land of Feeling  
            <span class="clickable" id="continue-reading",>forever</span>.</p>

        <h2 style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);text-align: center">PART 2: CONTINUEED...</h2> <span>
     
        <p >This cosmic plane, which currently inhabits the Eterna Star and the Bubble, includes a 3rd entity, the Sun, the centre of the universe. Returning back to the Bubble and Star’s conflict, the bubble, still unrelenting, decides to destroy the people’s belief in the Eterna Star, as the hope in the Eterna Star is what keeps the Star immortal and still standing strong. The Bubble created an illusion that removed the Eterna Star’s
            <span class="clickable" id="sixth-change",> face</span>, this surprised the Eterna Star as it had never come across a foe willing to destroy the image of it's opponent all in the sake of getting an advantage.</p>   <div></div>

        <p >In the eyes of the residents of Feeling, this was the event they feared the most, their pillar of unrelenting knowledge, lost forever… or so it seemed. See from the mere mortal’s perspective, all that remains is the bubble that has taken the place of their new lord, the Bubble alone stands tall, being the new pillar, of not emotion and humanity, but pure destruction. Residents of Feeling however do not know that their lord still very much exists, still watching over its people while fighting off the Bubble. Though the Star can not do it alone. Unbeknownst to the Bubble, the Star enlisted the help of the Sun to 
            <span class="clickable" id="fifth-change",> move away from the Star </span>and also the Bubble, making the image of the Bubble present in the lives of the residents of Feeling to feel at ease that the Bubble does not exist anymore, at least from their own point of view.</p>

        <p >With both the Bubble and the Star, both getting weaker since the removal of the Sun, they soon cease their fighting in the now void. They come to understand that the Bubble has always been there, and what led to the chaos that resulted, derived from its jealousy and feelings of being neglected as a powerful entity. They acknowledge one another and also the residents of the land of Feeling as all being one part of a system that feeds into one another, the residents gaining their whole being from the Eterna Star, the Star and the Bubble gaining its power from the all powerful centre of the universe, and without it, there would be no life that could possibly be sustained. The Eterna Star made a 
            <span class="clickable" id="seventh-change"> last call </span>and was able to bring the Sun back home, allowing the two entities to live in harmony.</p>
