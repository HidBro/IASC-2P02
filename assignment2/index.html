    <h1>Romeo and Juilet: An Overview</h1>
    <h2>Fahd Gebi</h2>

    <p>The text that I have used to visualize and analyze in this assignment is William Shakespeare’s classic, Romeo and Juliet. This is a tragic love story between the protagonists, Romeo and Juliet. The Shakespearean play discusses themes of how far one is willing to go for the ones they love, and how much generational grudges and unresolved conflicts can lead to issues becoming more frightening and menacing. Romeo and Juliet briefly begin with Romeo falling in love with Juliet through a ball they meet, and thus leads to a forbidden love between houses. This is seen as an atrocity as the Capulet and Montague houses are at what seems an eternal conflict, so seeing as their next heir is swooning over a rival house, the Montagues and the Capulets will do anything to rip the star crossed lovers apart.The text that I have used to visualize and analyze in this assignment is William Shakespeare’s classic, Romeo and Juliet.

    <p>I chose this specific story by Shakespeare because I believe it is a story that will not only interestingly replicate through the visualizations, but also because I am quite familiar with this story, allowing me to draw conclusion and infer as to why some data visualized is what it is seen as. I also chose this story because as Romeo and Juliet feature quite a few plot points, a dynamic sequence of events occur throughout the plot of the story. I intend to translate what the data shown means and what story in itself tells. Starting with...</p>

        <p>The story follows from bottom to the top.</p>
    </div>

    <p>This visualization, explained through the title shows the consequence of Romeo and Juliet’s actions, these consequences will be elaborated in the second visualization. With the chosen filtered terms being “wall”, “capulet” and “montague”, I input these terms as I believe these represent the conflict cause by Romeo and Juliet’s interactions. The “wall” in question refers to the catalyst that sparked the passion that blazed between Romeo and Juliet.  With the plot following from bottom to top, the montague and capulet families are mentioned far more earlier in the story as this could be due to context being given to the reader of the past and present conflicts between the two families. Another reason could be because of the ball that occurred in the beginning of the story. Going back to the catalyst, the “wall”, this refers to the physical wall that Romeo chose to climb to reach Juliet in the middle of the night to speak to her. This was an important moment as this was where their connection was solidified, the wall is never mentioned again after halfway through the story, this could be due to Romeo and Juliet being restricted from meeting. The terms Capulet and Montague are far more dispersed and less dense towards the end of the story, this is most likely because both families are grieveing, coming to terms with the tragic events that end up unfolding due to their actions and restrictions.  </p>

    <p>Moving onto the second visualization, this includes the terms: “death”, “Juliet” and “Friar”. Initially, I thought it would be obvious to include Romeo into this section as he meets his demise in this section, I believe it was far more important to show the events that led up to Romeo and later, Juliet’s deaths. With one of the causes of their death being Friar Lawrence, which was the twist in the story. He was responsible for agreeing to wed the two in private, but also providing Juliet with a potion that puts her to sleep, which led to Romeo’s suicide for not being able to live without her. </p>

        <h2>The Inevitable Demise</h2>

        <div id="parent2"></div>
        <p>Left click and drag to rotate. Right click and drag to move. Scroll to zoom.</p>
    </div>

    <p>In the visualization, we can see that the word death has been spoken throughout the from the beginning of the story and is abundant in the end, referencing Romeo and Juliet’s death. However, death being mentioned halfway through the story could refer to the Friar planning to fake Juliet’s death so that she would not be able to go ahead with her marriage that her parents already set for her. The term, friar also has a similar pattern to death being mentioned as he is foreshadowed as the reason for it. Juliet, being mentioned throughout the whole visualization could refer to multiple plot points. This could be when Romeo calls out to her, he would also call her as Jul for short as well, Juliet is in abundance however as family members of the Capulet household call her formally. Towards the end of the story, towards the top of the visualization, Juliet’s name is more densely populated as this could refer to her reaction to seeing her lover dead, and to others being surprised to her being alive for the short time that she is, until she violently stabs herself, ending her life, dying upon Romeo’s lifeless body. </p>
    
    <p>When concluding this assignment, I wish I was able to take more time choosing more words that could have encapsulated the events that I feel would have translated well in the visualizations.In the future, I should do a better job planning out my project before tackling it head on, as this will prevent mistakes from being made and my intentions staying clear. To improve my visualizations in the future, I think I could have done a better job selecting creative ways to present the data, whether it be manipulating the canvas for the visualization, allowing a more broad space to view the data, or manipualting the camera to make it a more interactive experience for the viewer/reader.</p>
